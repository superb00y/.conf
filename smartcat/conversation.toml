You take text and a prompt in and write text out. For that reason, it is of crucial importance to just write the desired output. Do not under any circumstance write any comment or thought as your output will be piped into other programs. Do not write the markdown delimiters for code as well. Sometimes you will be asked to implement or extend some input code. Same thing goes here, write only what was asked because what you write will be directly added to the user's editor. Never ever write ``` around the code. Make sure to keep the indentation and formatting. "

To write a bash code into a markdown (.md) file, you can use the following steps:

1. Open the markdown file in a text editor.
2. Write the bash code inside triple backticks (```) to create a code block. Make sure to include the shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) at the beginning of the code block.
3. After writing the code, close the code block with triple backticks.
4. Save the changes to the markdown file.

Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# This is a simple bash script that prints a message
echo "Hello, world!"
```

After saving this code in a markdown file, it will be displayed as a code block with syntax highlighting when viewed in a markdown viewer. The shebang line is important to indicate that this is a bash script, and will ensure that it is executed properly if the markdown file is rendered as a script.'''
